    <p>I remember when I started this blog space, I emotions were down every day. I desperately want a new job, that could save me from current job. Thanks god, I finally received an offer letter from a desired job. Words can't express how happy I was. How lucky I felt I was. I'm beyond grateful to have received it.</p>
    <p>My bf plays an important role in consistently supporting me throughout the process. Without him, everything would not turn out that smooth. We had a little celebration dinner, it was how the photo of fresh oysters came.</p>
    <p>Time to move on to next small stage of my life. And it's almost time to say bye to my current job. I sincerely thank it for teaching me a lot, despite of some unwanted experience. Good and bad ones, everything happened here became the nutrients for my future career. Cheers!</p>
