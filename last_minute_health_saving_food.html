    <p>It is dinner time again. Time to squeeze what to cook for dinner out.</p>
    <p>This happen when I was driving home from work. I started to brainstorm what are left inside the fridge. The all-the-time-ready eggs, ðŸ’¡, there is also a ginger left. Then, I realized my mentrual cycle is approaching. Why not cooking the "magical" ginger fried egg.</p>
    <p>I have been suffering from menstrual pain for 2 years+. I remember I heard from my mum that ginger fried egg is able to "magically" ease menstrual pain if eaten frequently. Ahaha, I used to think it is a myth and I actually dislike the taste of ginger. But now, I hope it will be working and act as a last-minute plan to save my coming mentrual pain.</p>
    <p>I have never cooked this dish, but I got the "voice" recipe from mum before. One dish is not enough, so will go to the grocery shop to make up one more simple dish.</p>
    <p>The dishes are done. I bring them to the living room and switch on the TV to watch the Indonesia Open 2024. Having dinner with badminton make the good time for my day. Love it. Though the plates and bowls can only be put on the floor as I do not have a proper coffee table.</p>
    <p>However, one big imperfect part is the taste of the ginger. It still taste so raw that I could not endure and need to pick all out. What I think: "I waste the "nutrition" in it. Will the effect still be as "magical" as it should be?" Oh sad, cries.</p>
