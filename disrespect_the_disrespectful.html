    <p>Recently I have been treated rude by a person at workplace.</p>
    <p>I became a victim of his discourtecy during a random day at work. I suffered a lot from getting rid of my anger during the time. I even went to a counsellor for the incident.</p>
    <p>People around me, especially my boyfriend, is worried of my mental conditions. He advised me not to take someone's word seriously, and get emotionally affect.</p>
    <p>The counsellor gave me a practical advice, which is to see the rude person as a mirror, to always remind myself never become a rude colleague at work.</p>
    <p>I received their advices and tried to make improvement on the way I thought. However, sometimes the aggresive feeling came back again when I interect with the rude guy.</p>

    <p>I feel like wanting to treat him rude, or even more rude, like how I got treated. However, I know I have to suppress my anger. Sometimes suppressing the aggressive feeling can be exhausting.</p>
    <p>Someone may think that the proper way should be telling him how I think about him. However, I cannot agree on that as for me, it is none of my reponsibilities to "educate" a "true" adult.</p>
    <p>Since then, I know that this person has lost all my respects. I feel disgusting and wanting to run away everytime when dealing with this person at work.</p>
